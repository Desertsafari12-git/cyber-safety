         <P>Teens should also understand that online interactions require the same respect as face-to-face ones and that persistent negative behavior is a form of bullying that should not be ignored. Additionally, teens should avoid clicking on suspicious links in texts or emails and only download apps and files from trusted, official sources. </P>
       <h2><u>HOW TO PROTECT PERSONEL INFORMATION</u></h2> 
        <P>To protect personal data and devices, teens should be careful about what they share online, like personal contact information, photos, and even details in their usernames that could be used to identify them. It's important to use strong, unique passwords for different accounts and to enable multi-factor authentication whenever possible.  </P>
        <p> scammers make Spoofed websites to make it look like a trusted source using Domain Spoofing techniques to disguse their true origin. And then in that site it would tell you to enter sensitive information while we believe that this is an official site. These kinds of sites usually ask for information like credit card number etc.  </p> 
        <p>Somtimes sites will request inforation like that. So if that site has a valid reason for asking the information, Uses HTTPS, Display trust indicators, Offer secure payment gateways Then that site might actualy be official but if The site does not have a clear reason for asking that information, Uses pop-ups or e-mails, Uses a poorly designed or unfamilliar sites and does not use HTTPS the site might be a fraudlent site</p>
